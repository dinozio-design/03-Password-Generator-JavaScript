<!-- ### From Scratch &mdash; _create a web application!_
<br> -->

## Description

In this week's Challenge! I created a web application from scratch! It will be a portfolio page, to which I will add as the course progresses. 

<!-- To create a responsive design this portfolio, I used some advanced CSS techniques, such as: 
* flexbox, 
* media queries,  
* CSS variables,
* Resets and Typography,
* Pseudo elements,
* Custom Forms,
* CSS selectors, and
* Variables.

To begin with, I used my sketch book to wireframe the flow of my application for the given **_User Story_** below. Here is a mockup of what it looked like:<br><br>

**Note:** In liue of web applications to showcase at this point, I use placeholder images and names.  -->


## User Story

<!-- ```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
``` -->


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

<!-- ```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio [TO DO: deployed link to load portfolio]
THEN I am presented with the developer's name [done], a recent photo or avatar [done], and links to sections about them [done], their work [Lipsum DONE], and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section [done]
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications [done]
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others [done]: implement flex 
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application [done]: git hub repos and other deployed applications
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport [done]: media queries
``` -->


## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## My Work
<!-- I started with a blank page and reviewed the modules as I built my first prototype. I was near completion and had only the media queries to implement, where I learned the hard truth about the "mobile-first approach". At this point I had learned a lot from each example, especially the mini-project. So instead of working my existing code, I decided to start fresh - thanks to reset. I simply renamed my css to _OLD*, then >touch styles.css in terminal and started fresh. That is why you see some _OLD files. I decided to keep them here to show the painstaking progress that I have made. :) -->
